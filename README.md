#  Carbon Emission Prediction 

Predicting Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) emissions using historical climate data and machine learning to support sustainable decision-making.

---

##  Project Overview

Carbon emissions are a major driver of global warming and climate change. This project uses historical climate data to **predict future CO₂ emission levels** from 2010 to 2030 using a **Random Forest Regressor**. It aims to support policymakers, environmental researchers, and sustainability engineers in planning climate-conscious strategies.

##  Problem Statement

> How can we accurately forecast carbon dioxide emissions to help reduce global warming?

CO₂ is a major greenhouse gas. Its increasing concentration is directly linked to extreme climate changes, rising temperatures, and ecological imbalance. Forecasting emissions gives countries a **data-driven foundation** to take preventive actions.

---

##  Solution

This project uses **Random Forest Regression** to build a reliable model that predicts future CO₂ emissions. The goal is to provide **insights for policy makers**, **climate engineers**, and **researchers** to develop actionable strategies for mitigation.

---

##  Future Scope

-  Extend model using **LSTM** or **GRU** for better time-series forecasting  
-  Integrate with **satellite imagery** using computer vision  
-  Build a **real-time CO₂ monitoring dashboard**  
-  Add geo-based modeling using **geospatial data**  
-  Deploy as a **public API or web app**
