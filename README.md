# Carbon Emission Prediction

This repository focuses on preparing data for analyzing **carbon emissions** using historical climate and economic indicators. The goal is to build a pipeline that can help understand and predict emission patterns for better climate-related policy and business decisions.

##  Current Stage: Data Preparation

###  Dataset: `climate_change.xls`
The dataset contains various indicators related to climate change, such as:
- CO2 emissions
- Energy consumption
- GDP
- Temperature anomalies
- Fossil fuel usage

  The data spans several years and includes economic and environmental variables across countries or globally.
